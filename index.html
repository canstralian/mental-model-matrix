Love it — this kit looks tight. For the sync layer, do you prefer Zapier or Pipedream?

- Zapier: fastest to ship, great if you want clicks-over-code
- Pipedream: more control, GitHub-friendly, easier to extend with custom logic

If you tell me which one you want, I’ll generate ready-to-run recipes with:

- Projects → Calendar: create or update milestones as events
- Calendar → Tasks: event changes update linked tasks
- GitHub ↔ Notion: PR opened/updated → create task, status sync on merge

To tailor the flows, share:

- Notion: URLs of your Projects and Tasks databases, plus the title/status/date property names
- Google Calendar: target calendar names or IDs per project
- GitHub: org/repo names and which events you care about (PR opened, labeled, merged)

Quick recommendation: Pipedream if you want repo-aware branching and testable code. Zapier if you want the simplest path today.

Hub is live.

- Projects and Tasks databases are set up and linked
- Your five projects are preloaded and color‑tagged
- First Friday milestone set to 2025‑10‑24 on each project
- “Project Hub” page now shows inline views and a color legend

Next, do you want me to:

1) Generate Pipedream or Zapier recipes for Notion ↔ Google Calendar ↔ GitHub?

2) Import your ICS calendars now? If yes, upload the ICS files and tell me which calendar each should go to, or share Calendar IDs for each project.

3) Add your GitHub repo links to each project so PR automations are ready?

I can add the Calendar IDs and GitHub repos right away, but I don’t have your ICS files or the IDs/URLs yet.

Please share:

- Calendar IDs per project
- GitHub repo URLs per project

If you prefer to import the ICS files:

- Upload each ICS here and tell me which project/calendar it maps to
- Or paste the Google Calendar IDs and I’ll record them in the Projects table so automations can target them

Tip: In Google Calendar web, go to Settings → the calendar → “Integrate calendar” → copy the Calendar ID.

Roadmaps added for all five projects.

- CodeTune Studio Lite
- Repo Healer
- Trading-Bot Swarm
- Hacker Hardware Hub
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights

Want me to:

- Convert each milestone into Tasks linked to its project and due on the listed Fridays?
- Mirror the milestones into your Google Calendars once you share Calendar IDs?

Milestone tasks created and linked to each project. They’re due on the Friday dates from the roadmaps.

To mirror these to Google Calendar, I need:

- Calendar ID for each project

And to ready PR automations, share the GitHub repo URL for each project. I’ll populate the Projects table with Calendar IDs and repo links, then wire up the calendar sync.

I’m ready, but I’m missing the critical details to proceed.

What I need from you now

- Google Calendar ID for each project
- GitHub repo URL for each project

Projects needing IDs and repos

- CodeTune Studio Lite
- Repo Healer
- Trading-Bot Swarm
- Hacker Hardware Hub
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights

How to get Calendar IDs

- Google Calendar → Settings → select the calendar → Integrate calendar → copy “Calendar ID”

Current sitrep

- Project Hub is live with linked Projects and Tasks, plus colour legend and next steps.
- All five projects created with colours set and first Friday milestone populated.
- Roadmaps added to each project page with weekly Friday milestones.
- Milestones mirrored as Tasks and linked to their projects with due dates on those Fridays.

Once you share the five Calendar IDs and repo URLs, I’ll:

- Populate the Projects table fields for Calendar ID and GitHub Repo
- Confirm bi-directional mapping and give you a brief follow-up sitrep

Thanks — that link opens Google Calendar’s marketing page and doesn’t include a usable Calendar ID.

Please paste the Calendar ID for each project and the GitHub repo URLs so I can wire everything up:

What I need

- Calendar IDs
- GitHub repos

How to find a Calendar ID in Google Calendar

- Settings
- Select the calendar in the left sidebar
- Integrate calendar
- Copy “Calendar ID” (looks like an email-style string)

If all five milestones should go to a single shared calendar, share that one ID and I’ll apply it to every project.

Thanks — that link doesn’t expose the Calendar ID, and I can’t read its contents due to access restrictions.

Please paste the actual Calendar ID string(s) and the GitHub repo URLs so I can wire everything up now.

What I need

- Calendar IDs
- GitHub repos

How to get a Calendar ID in Google Calendar

- Open Google Calendar
- Settings
- Select the target calendar in the left sidebar
- Integrate calendar
- Copy “Calendar ID” (looks like an email-style string, e.g. [abc123@group.calendar.google.com](mailto:abc123@group.calendar.google.com))

If you want all milestones on one shared calendar, send just that single ID and I’ll apply it to every project.

I can’t read that calendar link or extract its ID due to access restrictions.

Please paste the Calendar ID string(s) and each project’s GitHub repo URL so I can wire them up now.

Reply in this format:

- CodeTune Studio Lite — Calendar ID: … — Repo: https://github.com/…
- Repo Healer — Calendar ID: … — Repo: https://github.com/…
- Trading-Bot Swarm — Calendar ID: … — Repo: https://github.com/…
- Hacker Hardware Hub — Calendar ID: … — Repo: https://github.com/…
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights — Calendar ID: … — Repo: https://github.com/…

Tip: Google Calendar → Settings → select calendar → Integrate calendar → “Calendar ID” (email-like string ending with @[group.calendar.google.com](http://group.calendar.google.com)).

I can’t read that link or extract the Calendar ID due to access restrictions.

Please paste the Calendar ID string(s) and each repo URL so I can wire them up now. Example format:

- CodeTune Studio Lite — Calendar ID: [your-id@group.calendar.google.com](mailto:your-id@group.calendar.google.com) — Repo: https://github.com/org/repo
- Repo Healer — Calendar ID: … — Repo: …
- Trading-Bot Swarm — Calendar ID: … — Repo: …
- Hacker Hardware Hub — Calendar ID: … — Repo: …
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights — Calendar ID: … — Repo: …

Tip: Google Calendar → Settings → select calendar → Integrate calendar → copy “Calendar ID”.

Calendar ID added to all five projects.

Sit rep

- Calendar ID recorded on:
- Milestone tasks already created and dated for each Friday.

Next step to finish “both”

- Send the GitHub repo URL for each project and I’ll populate the Projects table, then generate ready-to-run sync recipes so milestones create and update Google Calendar events automatically using your shared calendar ID.

Got it — I’ve applied those Calendar IDs to four projects:

- CodeTune Studio Lite
- Repo Healer
- Trading-Bot Swarm
- Hacker Hardware Hub

Open item

- I still need the Calendar ID for HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights, or confirm that it should use the same shared calendar currently on it.

Next needed to finish “both”

- GitHub repo URL for each project so I can populate the Projects table and prep the sync recipes.

HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights calendar ID added.

Current status

- All five projects now have Calendar IDs set.
- Milestone tasks are created and dated across projects.

To finish wiring automations, I still need the GitHub repo URL for each project. Send one per line like:

- CodeTune Studio Lite — https://github.com/ORG/REPO
- Repo Healer — …
- Trading-Bot Swarm — …
- Hacker Hardware Hub — …
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights — …

Once I have those, I’ll populate the Projects table and generate ready-to-run Pipedream or Zapier recipes for Notion ↔ Google Calendar ↔ GitHub.

Added the repo for CodeTune Studio Lite to the project.

Send the remaining repo URLs so I can finish wiring:

- Repo Healer
- Trading-Bot Swarm
- Hacker Hardware Hub
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights

Optional now: confirm Zapier or Pipedream for the Notion ↔ Google Calendar ↔ GitHub automations.

Added the repo to Trading-Bot Swarm.

Still needed to finish wiring:

- Repo Healer repo URL
- Hacker Hardware Hub repo URL
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights repo URL

Optional: confirm whether you want Zapier or Pipedream for the Notion ↔ Google Calendar ↔ GitHub automations.

Added the repo to Hacker Hardware Hub.

Still needed

- Repo Healer — repo URL
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights — repo URL

Once I have those, I’ll populate the remaining fields and generate the automation recipes. Do you prefer Zapier or Pipedream for the Notion ↔ Google Calendar ↔ GitHub sync?

Got it. Thanks for the recon.

What I can do now

- Calendar sync: I can generate the automation recipes to mirror Milestone Tasks → Google Calendar events using the Calendar IDs you’ve provided. This part doesn’t depend on GitHub.
- GitHub sync: For PR-based automations, I still need exact repo URLs for:

About your candidates

- Trading-Bot Swarm: you already gave me canstralian/trading-bot-swarm, so we’re set there.
- Hacker Hardware Hub: linked to your canstralian/HackerHardwareNet already.
- “Fork of” https://github.com/chiyonn/swarmyard?utm_source=chatgpt.com: if you want, I can note this as a reference in Trading-Bot Swarm or leave as-is since we have your repo set.

Two quick options to proceed

1) Generate Pipedream recipes now for:

2) Share the missing repo URLs (or your GitHub org so I can narrow to repos under it), and I’ll wire the full tri-sync in one pass.

Which do you prefer?

Added an Automation recipes section to the Project Hub with ready-to-run Pipedream and Zapier outlines, mappings, and env vars. This gets Tasks ↔ Calendar syncing set up now, with GitHub scaffolds to fill in later.

Next steps

- If you want, I can turn the Pipedream outline into runnable workflows next. Confirm Pipedream and I’ll generate step-by-step actions you can paste in.
- When ready, share the remaining repo URLs for Repo Healer and HF Space, and I’ll drop them into Projects and finalize the GitHub automations.

Done — I added runnable Pipedream workflows and Zapier zaps to the Project Hub under “Automation recipes” and “Runnable recipes.”

Next quick steps

- Connect Notion, Google Calendar, and (later) GitHub in Pipedream or Zapier
- Run the checklist at the bottom and create one test Task with a Due date to verify event creation

When you’re ready, share the remaining repo URLs for:

- Repo Healer
- HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights

I’ll drop them into Projects and finalize the GitHub parts of the automations.

Nice finds. I’ve linked HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights to the GitHub→HF Space sync utility repo you shared.

Open items to finish wiring

- CodeTune Studio Lite: you earlier gave canstralian/codetunestudio, and you’ve now suggested CodeTuneStudio.
- Repo Healer: still need the repo URL, or confirm it’s not created yet.

Trading-Bot Swarm and Hacker Hardware Hub are already linked to their repos.

Once you confirm CodeTuneStudio vs codetunestudio and provide Repo Healer’s repo (or “none yet”), I’ll finalize the GitHub automation placeholders.

Confirmed — switched CodeTune Studio Lite to the CodeTuneStudio repo and kept the rest as is.

Current wiring

- Repos linked: CodeTune Studio Lite, Trading-Bot Swarm, Hacker Hardware Hub, HF Space Repo Auto-Fix & Insights
- Repo Healer: still need the repo URL. If it doesn’t exist yet, I’ll leave GitHub automations for that project in placeholder mode.

Want me to proceed generating the concrete Pipedream workflows now so you can click “Deploy,” or wait until you share Repo Healer’s repo?

All set — I added the runnable Pipedream and Zapier deploy steps to your Project Hub under “Runnable recipes.”

Quick test

- Create a Task with Project = CodeTune Studio Lite and a Due date
- Confirm the all‑day event appears on its calendar
- Edit the event date in Google Calendar and verify the Task’s Due updates

Open item

- Repo Healer: share the repo URL when ready and I’ll finalize the GitHub automation mapping.

Great prompt. The most central for “ready to ship” in your pattern is Feedback Loops.

Why

- Fast, observable signals decide readiness for you: CI green, basic telemetry stable, a small pilot’s usage and complaints. That’s how you cut through uncertainty.
- Pareto then shapes scope, but the go/no-go hinges on what the loop is telling you right now.
- Risk Surface Minimization is your default release posture, but its thresholds are also set by the loop quality.

Practical ship test you already use (and we can formalize):

- A tight feedback loop exists and is active
- One “happy path” is proven by real users or a realistic harness
- A rollback plan is verified, not just written
- A single metric moves in the right direction for a week

If you agree, I’ll layer complementary models around Feedback Loops next:

- Shipyard Gates: objective, automatable pre-ship checks
- Signal Quality Index: a quick score for whether you can trust today’s signals
- Minimum Insight Release: “ship when you’ll learn the most next week,” not just when it’s “done”

Awesome. Building around Feedback Loops, here’s the compact “ship-readiness” stack you can apply immediately.

### 1) Shipyard Gates

Objective checks you pass before shipping:

- Telemetry alive: errors under X% and p50 latency under Y
- CI/CD green: main branch, release workflow, rollback job
- Canary path works: 1 verified happy path with real data
- Reversible: rollback tested in the last 7 days
- Owner on call: who watches metrics for 24–48h

Make it binary. If any gate fails, you don’t ship.

### 2) Signal Quality Index (SQI)

Score whether today’s signals are trustworthy (0–5 each, total / 25):

- Coverage: do your dashboards cover user journeys?
- Freshness: data < 5 min old?
- Stability: no flaky alerts in past week?
- Representativeness: pilot users mirror target users?
- Actionability: clear next action when metric moves?

Ship only if SQI ≥ 18 and no single dimension is ≤ 2.

### 3) Minimum Insight Release (MIR)

Instead of “done,” ship when the next week’s learning will be maximal:

- Hypothesis: one falsifiable claim per release
- Metric: 1 north-star or proxy tied to that claim
- Exposure: smallest cohort that will still prove/disprove
- Decision rule: in advance, define “ship more,” “iterate,” or “rollback”

### 4) Fast Rituals

- 10-minute Release Review: run Gates + SQI + MIR. Decide.
- 24-hour Scan: did the metric move as hypothesized?
- 7-day Insight: keep or cut. Fold learnings into defaults.

### 5) Where this fits your current projects

- CodeTune Studio Lite: “Happy path” = first fix under 3 minutes. MIR on first-run conversion and median fix time.
- Trading-Bot Swarm: paper-trade risk controls as canary. MIR on slippage and daily uptime.
- Hacker Hardware Hub: drop-day funnel. MIR on PDP→checkout conversion.
- HF Space Auto-Fix: PR merge rate and repeat-error reduction. MIR on merge rate > 60%.

If you want, I can add a lightweight checklist to each project page (Shipyard Gates + SQI + MIR) and a weekly “Release Review” task per project.

Added the Shipyard Gates, Signal Quality Index, and Minimum Insight Release checklists to each project page, and created a “Weekly Release Review” task for all five projects due this Friday.

Anything you want tweaked in the gates or SQI scoring before we roll with them?

Perfect. We’ll run with these as-is.

Next up:

- Use the “Runnable recipes” on Project Hub to deploy the Pipedream workflows.
- Create one test Task with a Due date to confirm event creation.
- When you have Repo Healer’s repo (and any HF Space tweaks), send the URLs and I’ll finalize the GitHub automations.

Created a test task “Test calendar sync” for CodeTune Studio Lite due tomorrow to validate the Calendar workflow.

Next:

- Deploy the Pipedream “Notion Tasks → Google Calendar” workflow from the Project Hub
- Confirm that an all‑day event appears on the CodeTune Studio Lite calendar for the Due date
- If it looks good, I’ll roll the same pattern to the other projects’ weekly milestones automatically once you confirm

Great. If you want, I can:

- Duplicate the “Test calendar sync” pattern across all projects for a quick end-to-end check
- Generate next week’s demo-cadence tasks from the roadmaps

Otherwise, you’re ready to run with the current setup.

This looks great. In Notion, there are two good ways to use it:

Option 1 — Host and embed

- Host the HTML (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
- In Notion, type /embed and paste the hosted URL to get the full interactive dashboard.

Option 2 — Convert to Notion-native

- Create a Notion page section with the five models as toggles or callouts.
- Add a simple 0–10 rating control per model using a Number property in a small inline database and a Chart view for a radar/parallel substitute.
- Result: fully Notion-native, no external JS, but less visual than Chart.js.

Quick notes about your HTML:

- You’re using Chart.js and Tailwind via CDN, which won’t execute inside Notion directly. It must be hosted and embedded as a webpage.
- Radar labels: [modelsData.map](http://modelsData.map)(m => m.title.split(' ')) splits titles into multiple words per axis label. Consider labels: [modelsData.map](http://modelsData.map)(m => m.title) for cleaner axes.
- Initial slider sync is solid. If you want persistence, store scores in localStorage and rehydrate on load.

If you want, I can:

- Spin up a minimal GitHub Pages version from this snippet and give you a URL to embed.
- Or build the Notion-native version on your Project Hub with toggles and a lightweight scoring table.

Done. I created a page with a deploy-and-embed guide plus a ready-to-copy index.html. Paste this into a new GitHub Pages site, publish, then embed the URL back in Notion.

- Mental Model Matrix (embed + deploy guide)

When your Pages URL is live, drop it into the “Embed” section on that page and you’ll have the interactive dashboard in Notion.

Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide to get your Mental Model Matrix live and embedded in Notion, plus tips to customize and troubleshoot.

### What this is

- A single-page, interactive dashboard that explains your five core mental models.
- Sliders update a radar chart in real time to visualize what’s central in your decision-making.

### How to deploy (GitHub Pages)

1) Create a repo

- Name suggestion: mental-model-matrix
- Visibility: Public

2) Add your file

- In the repo, click Add file → Create new file
- Name it index.html
- Paste the HTML from the “index.html” section on Mental Model Matrix (embed + deploy guide)
- Commit to main

3) Enable Pages

- Repo → Settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from branch
- Branch: main
- Folder: /root
- Save
- Wait 1–3 minutes for the Pages URL to appear

4) Test it

- Open the Pages URL in a new tab
- Confirm the cards expand and sliders update the radar chart

5) Embed in Notion

- Copy your Pages URL
- In Mental Model Matrix (embed + deploy guide), replace the placeholder with your URL
- Or on any page: type /embed and paste the URL

### Alternative: Netlify or Vercel

- Drag-and-drop the index.html into Netlify ([netlify.app](http://netlify.app)) or deploy with Vercel
- Copy the live URL and embed in Notion

### Customization tips

- Labels: The code now uses full titles for radarChart labels. If you prefer shorter axes, change labels to something like ["Pareto","Feedback","Compounding","Risk","Orchestration"].
- Color theme: Adjust Tailwind colors in the class names (currently teal and stone neutrals).
- Initial scores: Change initialScores = [modelsData.map](http://modelsData.map)(() => 5) to your preferred defaults.
- Persistence: Add localStorage to save slider positions:

Example snippet:

const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('mmm-scores') || '[]');

if (saved.length === modelsData.length) initialScores = saved;

...

slider.addEventListener('input', e => {

});

### Troubleshooting

- “Blank” embed in Notion
- Chart not rendering
- Styling looks off

### Good practices

- Pin library versions for stability (Chart.js, Tailwind) to avoid breaking changes.
- Keep the HTML single-file for easy hosting and embedding.
- If you want collaboration, add a short README with deploy steps in the repo.

If you want, I can add a localStorage-enabled version of the HTML to your guide page so your ratings persist across visits.
